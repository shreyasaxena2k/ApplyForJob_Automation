# ApplyForJob_Automation

Hey guy!!
As we all know that this pandemic has left many people jobless, so thinking of that I tried to build this ApplyForJob Web Automation using #puppeteer which automatically->
* Search for the required job which the user wants to apply for.
* Finds out the best result and takes it to the form application page.
* Fill in the required details of the user(Resume upload, Personal & Technical details).
* Click on the APPLY Button and takes the snapshot of the SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION PAGE.
